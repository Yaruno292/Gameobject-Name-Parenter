# Gameobject-Name-Parenter
Parents 2 selected gameobjects into eachother

## Reason
I created this script to make it easier
and less time consuming to put 2 armatures together.

You have to do this for custom clothes for your avatar
in VRChat.

## Functions
It reparents the "oldParent's" children into the "newParent" by matching the names.
If the names don't match it puts it into the parent above it.

## How to use
Simply drag in the prefab named: ScriptRunner
Select the 2 GameObjects you want to parent into eachother.

New Parent: This is the GameObject you are going to use in the end. aka the result.
Old Parent: This is the GameObject you want to put the children into the other GameObject. (Clothes armature)

After putting in the GameObjects you simply press PLAY and the script will run.
If you are not happy with the result just exit play mode and it will reset.

If you want to save the changes, simply copy the GameObject in playmode.
And paste it after you exited playmode.
